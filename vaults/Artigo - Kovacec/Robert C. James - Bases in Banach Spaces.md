## Shauder Basis

A Shauder Basis for a Banach Space $X$ is a sequence $\{e_{n}\}_{1}^\infty$ of members of $X$ which has the property that for each $x$ in $X$, there is exactly one sequence of scalars $\{x_{i}\}$ for which $x=\sum_{1}^\infty x_{i}e_{i}$ in the sense that $$\lim_{ n \to \infty }\lvert  \rvert  x-\sum_{1}^\infty x_{i}e_{i}\lvert  \rvert =0$$
