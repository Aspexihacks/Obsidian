## Shauder Basis

A Shauder Basis for a Banach Space $X$ is a sequence $\{e_{n}\}_{1}^\infty$ of members of $X$ which has the property that for each $x$ in $X$, there is exactly one sequence of scalars $\{x_{i}\}$ for which $x=\sum_{1}^\infty x_{i}e_{i}$ in the sense that $$\lim_{ n \to \infty }\bigg\lvert  \bigg\rvert  x-\sum_{1}^\infty x_{i}e_{i}\bigg\lvert  \bigg\rvert =0.$$
### Orthogonal Sequences in Hilbert Spaces

Any orthogonal sequence in a Hilbert Space $H$ and $x$ is any member of $H$, then there is exactly one sequence $\{x_i\}$ of scalars such that $\lim_{ n \to \infty }\big\lvert  \big\rvert  x-\sum_{1}^\infty x_{i}e_{i}\big\lvert  \big\rvert =0.$ For this sequence of scalars, each $x_{i}$ is $(x,e_{i})$ and$$\big\lvert  \big\rvert  x-\sum_{1}^\infty x_{i}e_{i}\big\lvert  \big\rvert$$
