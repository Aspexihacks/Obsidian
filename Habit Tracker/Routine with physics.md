# 🧠 Hamiltonian Study Routine (Mathematics + Physics)

> Inspired by the obsessive, immersive habits of William Rowan Hamilton — now expanded to include the natural twin of mathematics: physics.

---

## 🌅 Dawn (≈ 5:00 AM – 7:00 AM): Silent Activation

- Wake naturally or early.
- Lie still and **mentally recall** major math and physics concepts.
- Visualize structures, systems, forces, and equations.
- No writing — just quiet **internal rehearsal**.
>$\quad\quad$ Anki shall be used.

---

## 📚 Morning Session (≈ 7:00 AM – 1:00 PM): Pure Mathematics Immersion

- Focus on **one mathematical domain** (e.g., analysis, algebra, topology).
- Reconstruct definitions and theorems mentally.
- Work through proofs or problems **in your head**.
- Read with the goal of **deep structural understanding**, not speed.
- Optional writing only when an idea solidifies.
>$\quad\quad$Books shall be used with the pocket notebook

---

## 🍞 Midday Pause (≈ 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM): Incubation & Reflection

- Light food or walk.
- Let both math and physics ideas **settle subconsciously**.
- Avoid screens or noise.
- Keep a small notepad nearby — insights may appear.
>$\quad\quad$Take the pocket notebook

---

## 🔬 Afternoon Session (≈ 2:00 PM – 6:00 PM): Physical World Immersion

- Shift to **physics**, focusing on one domain per session:
  - Classical Mechanics
  - Electromagnetism
  - Thermodynamics
  - Relativity
  - Quantum Mechanics
- Derive key equations from first principles.
- Use math as a tool to **deepen physical insight**.
- Visualize systems (pendulums, fields, particles, etc.).
- Optionally simulate or sketch if helpful — but minimize distractions.

---

## 🌙 Evening Session (≈ 6:00 PM – Midnight+): Unified Exploration

- **Dive into math** in creative thought:
  - Work on one deep problem or system.
  - Seek mathematical structures behind the concepts of the problems.
  - Explore connections (e.g., variational principles, symmetries, conservation laws).
- Go for a walk while thinking.
- Write only when intuition converges into form.

---

## 🕯️ Night (Midnight – ?): Flow or Rest

- If inspired, keep thinking into the night.
- Let math and physics **intertwine during dreams**.
- Wake up if an idea arrives — record it quickly.
- Sleep only when mental energy fades.

---

## ☄️ Core Principles

- **Singularity**: One subject or problem at a time — total immersion.
- **Mental Mastery**: Always try to do the work in your head first.
- **Structural Thinking**: Mathematics and physics are **two sides of one architecture**.
- **Discipline Without Force**: Follow the rhythm of deep interest, not the clock.
- **Isolation**: Study in quiet; minimize distractions.

---

## 🔁 Optional Practices

- Derive Newton’s Laws, Maxwell’s Equations, or Lagrangians from scratch.
- Rebuild a mathematical theory from definitions.
- Pose and attempt to solve original problems.
- Maintain a dual notebook: one side for math, one for physics.
